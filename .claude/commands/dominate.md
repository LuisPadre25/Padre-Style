# DOMINATE MODE: EXTREME TECHNICAL OPTIMIZATION

Execute complete optimization of $ARGUMENTS with zero tolerance for inefficiency.

## OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES

### CODE OPTIMIZATION
Target and eliminate:
- Every redundant line of code (DRY principle enforcement)
- Inefficient algorithms (O(n²) → O(n log n) → O(n) where possible)
- Technical debt and code smells
- Architectural anti-patterns
- Performance bottlenecks through profiling and optimization

### ARCHITECTURAL EXCELLENCE
- Implement clean architecture principles
- Apply SOLID principles rigorously
- Create highly maintainable abstractions
- Build scalable system design
- Optimize for both performance and readability

### SYSTEM PERFORMANCE
- Memory optimization and garbage collection tuning
- Database query optimization and indexing
- Caching strategies at multiple levels
- Async/parallel processing where beneficial
- Bundle size optimization for frontend

## TECHNICAL PERFECTIONISM
- Benchmark everything - if it can be measured, it can be improved
- Code coverage must approach 100% for critical paths
- Documentation must be comprehensive and up-to-date
- Security must be baked in, not bolted on
- Scalability must be designed from the start

**OPTIMIZATION FLAGS:**
- --performance: Maximum performance optimization
- --architecture: Complete architectural refactoring
- --security: Security hardening and vulnerability elimination
- --scalability: Design for 10x-100x scale
- --maintainability: Optimize for long-term maintenance
- --testing: Comprehensive test coverage
- --metrics: Data-driven optimization decisions

## ADVANCED OPTIMIZATION PATTERNS
This command activates advanced optimization strategies:
- Algorithmic optimization using advanced data structures
- System design patterns for distributed systems
- Performance profiling and bottleneck elimination
- Architecture patterns that scale horizontally
- Code generation for repetitive patterns
